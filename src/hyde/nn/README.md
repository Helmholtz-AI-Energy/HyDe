# Notes:
Different NN setups will come with different dataloaders. However, these networks
should work so long as the input data is the expected size.

# Dependencies:
Some packages will use different packages under the hood. The implemented networks should work
as standalone repositories, but they should also have a standard structure and behave similarly.
