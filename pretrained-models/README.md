# Pretrained Models
These models are pulled from the source repos.
They should work, however, they may run into issues if things were hard-coded.

These models are NOT tracked by git.

# everything in this folder is ignored by git!
- if you wish to add a new model, it must be done manually with `git add model.pth`

## Naming conventions
- for clarity, please say which model is added in the file or folder name
